 IMPORTANT: It is possible for the value(s) of \c element to change (again)
 between when your handler is scheduled for execution and when it actually
 executes.  This may cause your application to "miss" changes to the element.
 If your application needs to track every element state change - as opposed to
 just the latest element state - use the methods under "Buffered Input".
